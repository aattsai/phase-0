# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#I used .each to iterate through my hash and to add each of the value by the integer passed on by the second argument
#For array I used map! to iterate through array destructively. I learned that by using .each here, the array returned at the end will remain as the initial array. Therefore I chose map! to make the destructive modification to my array.
#I also used .is_a (Integer) to check if the element is a integer, if so, I add the value up by the argument provided.

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.

#
#


# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
