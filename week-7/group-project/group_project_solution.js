User story

As a user, I want to run a Javascript based program that can
perform a few arithmetic and statistical operations with integers.
These integers will be provided in two sets of arrays, one with
an odd number of integers, the other with an even number of integers.

1. SUM - This program will have to accept all the integers from these
two arrays, and add them up to acquire the sum of each set of integers.

2. Mean - This program will take all the integers from each of these
arrays, and find the means of each set of the numbers. Mean is
calculated by taking the sum of the all integers, divided by the
total number of integers.

3.Median - Finally, this program will take the sets of numbers and
calculate the median for each of the two sets. Median is defined as
the number that lies at the midpoint of a frequency distribution. In
other words, This program must find the number in the middle of the
list when the numbers are sorted in order from smallest to largest.
