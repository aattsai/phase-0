<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was interesting to see how easy it is to turn the HTML we have learned thus far into an actual site. Since we are still creating simple webpage without any styling, the writing and seeing result was almost instantaneous.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  It was fun reading about HTML5 elements. It seems like HTML5 has more focus on organization, which is a great implementation so the programmers don't get too confused when working on large chunk of code.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  Good. It made it simple for now since we don't have to worry to much about styling. A better way to learn and to pick up html at first I think, since this way we don't get confused by implementing styling in html.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  I think both the good and the bad about html is that it is very simple. I think it is relatively easy to learn and to implement right away. But due to its simplicity, you can't really create a complex webpage using html only.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  I used the cheatsheet provided on Canvas for the tags.
