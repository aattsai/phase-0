##What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
  The primary goal of my site is to introduce some of the projects I worked on in the past. It will include the design concept and featured products of a bar I co-found. Depending on how much time I get to work on the site, I will possibly feature a project I worked on during graduate school.
##What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  I think my target audience's interests lie in learning about the kind of work I've done in the past. Due to the wide array of the kind of work I've done in past, the best way to illustrate to the majority of my audience will be providing visual presentation on the site.
##What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
  The primary action the user should take when coming to my site is to see my portfolio. Perhaps it would be great for the users to leave feedback about my prior work and contact me if they wish to continue the conversation about my work.
##What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  I think the main things someone should know about design and user experience is that it should be user-centered, meaning the most important part is that a user can easily navigate around the site without much difficulty. Because it should be user-centered, it is critical to determine who your target audiences are when you create and design the website.
##What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
  User expereince design is how a user feels when interfacing with a system. It includes a website's usability but much more, such as psychology and information architecture. It is valuable because the the number of web users have grown dramatically and that websites have gotten a lot more complex in terms of features. Therefore it requires UX design to provide the best usability for a wide range of users to easily navigate the website.
##Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  I found writing these reflections a bit tedious as I kind of want to just dive in and start creating my website.
