<!-- Add your reflection here -->
<!-- # This challenge took me [1] hours. -->

<!-- What did you learn about the DOM?
  I learned how to add class and modify css properties using the DOM.
  I also learned about the template tag that I've never seen before.
What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
  The basic access methods are useful. Also I think changing CSS
  properties are very useful methods as well.  -->
