      <h2>What are the benefits of version control?</h2>
      <p>Version control is critical because projects call for multiple members to a team. It's not possible to always be collaborating side by side, so aach member will be working with their own local copies. Keeping tabs on all copies allows each team member to work with autonomy, and the team will still be able to maintain a master copy of everyone's collective, merged work at the end of the day.

      Another important advantage comes in if new code introduces bugs. Version control allows the team to rollback to their latest, functioning version while they work to fix the bug.</p>

      <h2>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h2>
      <p>git allows the user to push incremental commits to the remote repo. All commits are saved to a history, which can be viewed on GitHub or by typing git log on the CLI.</p>

      <h2>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h2>
      <p>GitHub is a central hub that all team members can access to collaborate on projects. Fully merged, master versions of code can be pulled, updated, and stored at any time.</p>

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  In this challenge we used the basic tags like html, head, title, and body as well as tags from the html 5 semantic elements such as section, main, footer, header. We keep returning to section tag to create different sections for the page. Essentially we divided up the entire blog into three secitons, each consists of a separate question.
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  The elements get laid out in a top to down fashion. The order goes something like from header to section then to footer just as we set it out to be.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  We learned how to create snippet so that we can quickly establish the basic html format from the get-go. During the process of researching creating our own snippet, I also saw a lot of different shortcuts avaliable, as well as ones we can create.
