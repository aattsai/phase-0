###Describe what open source means.
   It is the practice of sharing the source code of how a program is made so that anyone can access it and customize the program as they see fit.
###What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  I like the practice of Open Source in general. Because it allows multiple parties to look at how a program is made and can possibly come up with the improvement for the better and more efficient codes. It does not make me feel nervous but I do wonder if most developers would be willing to put up their best work on Open Source.
###Assess the importance of using licenses.
  Licenses allow the creator of a program to retain all his rights as the owner of that program while providing permissions for others to use that work. It is important because it allows open source usage of your program while protecting you as the original creator. Therefore you don't have to worry about work being claimed as someone else's.
###What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  I was not familiar with navigating Git and creating Pull Requests prior to this challenge, and was struggling for a while. After Committing and Pushing the website on GitHub, I believe I have gotten a lot more comfortable using git and GitHub. When I finally published the website online, it felt kind of like an "aha" moment.
###Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  I found http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ an easy illlustration on how to navigate git and GitHub. It was found on the DBC chatroom.
