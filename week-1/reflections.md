#1.1 Think About Time Reflection
  I learned about tiny habits, time-management tools such as the Pomodoro Technique, meditation methods, and how to focus get into "the zone" where you can be fully energized and focus on a certain task. Time Boxing is a method to limit each work session to a confined number of minutes. Then stopped working once the time is up and evaluate the work done during that time. I currently don't employ a specific method for time-management. I do, however, set up goals of the day, and divide up the workload and try to accomplish each tasks throughout the day as planned. My current time-management plan is working, but not optimized because I lack systematic way to actually focus on completing the tasks, thereby creating a lot of wasted time through distraction. By employing additional methods, I can easily accomplish more and save up more time for other things. I would try daily meditation to build up my overall focus. Also I would like to incentivize my behavior by setting daily goals based on what I really want to accomplish for that day. Lastly, I would like to try time boxing to try to maximize my productivity within a certain time-frame, drive out unnecessary distraction when I am suppose to be focused on working. During Phase 0, I would like to create a systematic method for time-management that I am comfortable with, and get used to employing these methods on a daily basis to increase productivity and reduce wasted time.

#1.2 The Command Line Reflection
  A shell is any program that takes the command given through either command-line or graphical interface to the operating system to perform certain tasks. Bash is command language that users can employ to enter commands to the operating system.

  For me the most challenging part going through this material is pipes and redirection. Initially I was not certain the purpose of piping outputs to a separate command.

  Yes, I was able to try all the commands introduced.

  I think the most important commands are the ones that navigates in and out of directories such as cd and ls because it is probably the most commonly used command and that without using them proficiently, lots of time can be wasted.

  pwd - prints working directory.

  ls - list all the files and directories inside current directory.

  mv - move a file, but actually, it works more like renaming the file.

  cd - change directory;

  ../ to go back to the host directory

  touch - creates an empty text file

  mkdir - creates a new directory

  less - display the content of a text file

  rmdir - remove a directory

  rm - remove a file


#1.3 Forking and Cloning Reflection
  To create a new repo, you first log on to your GitHub account. Find the + icon on the homepage's top right corner, click it and select New repository. You then enter the name of your repo and select create. To fork a repo, you find the repo desired, then click on fork on the top right corner. To clone, you copy the URL within the forked repo. Go to command terminal, find the directory you wish to clone the repo in, type in git clone and the URL copied.

  You fork a repo when the content you are looking for has already been created as opposed to having to create a new one entirely.

  I encountered no struggle setting up git and GitHub. By following the instruction allowed me to set up everything smoothly.
